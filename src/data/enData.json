    "bandName":"Depeche Mode",
    "biography": "Depeche Mode are an English synthrock band formed in Basildon in 1980. Originally formed by the lineup of Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke, the band currently consists of Gahan (lead vocals, co-songwriting) and Gore (keyboards, guitar, co-lead vocals, primary songwriting). Depeche Mode released their debut album Speak & Spell in 1981 amid the British new wave scene. They recorded their second album, A Broken Frame (1982), as a trio, following Clarke's departure from the band. Gore took over as main songwriter and Alan Wilder replaced Clarke, establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years. The albums Black Celebration (1986) and Music for the Masses (1987) established them as a dominant force within the electronic and alternative music scenes, and their June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early 1990, they released their seventh album, Violator, an international mainstream success. The following album Songs of Faith and Devotion (1993) was also a success, though the band's internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995. The band continued with the trio lineup of Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher until Fletcher's death in 2022.",
